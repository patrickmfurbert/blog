# Building My First Blog: Learning to Code with AI

Hi, I'm Patrick! This marks my first attempt at building a blog completely from scratch. My goal is to develop a habit of learning to code alongside AI tools, documenting the journey as I go.

I've worked with various technologies in the past â€“ SpringBoot, React, Svelte â€“ and have deployed projects on Netlify before. But this time, I wanted to embrace AI as a true coding partner rather than just an occasional helper.

## Why AI-Assisted Development?

I know AI-assisted development can be controversial for some developers. However, I believe it's simply part of working in the modern development landscape. My company recently invested in GitHub Copilot after switching from Windsurf, so I'm using AI both professionally and for personal projects like this blog.

The reality is that AI tools are here to stay, and they're becoming increasingly sophisticated. Rather than resist this change, I've chosen to lean into it and explore how it can enhance my development process.

## What I'm Building

This blog is built with modern technologies that I'm passionate about:

- **SvelteKit** - For lightning-fast performance and developer experience
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe development
- **MDsveX** - For markdown processing with Svelte components
- **Netlify** - For seamless deployment and hosting

## The AI Partnership Approach

Working with AI isn't about letting it write all my code. It's about:

- **Faster prototyping** - Getting ideas from concept to working code quickly
- **Learning acceleration** - Understanding new patterns and best practices
- **Problem-solving** - Having a coding partner to bounce ideas off
- **Documentation** - Getting help with clear, concise explanations

Here's a typical workflow I've developed:

```bash
# 1. Start with a clear goal
$ echo "I want to add YouTube embeds to my blog"

# 2. Work with AI to explore solutions
# 3. Implement and iterate together
# 4. Test and refine the approach
```

## Lessons Learned So Far

Through building this blog, I've discovered several key insights:

### 1. AI Amplifies Skills, Doesn't Replace Them

The more I understand about web development fundamentals, the better I can guide AI to help me. It's like having a very knowledgeable pair programming partner.

### 2. Still Need to Understand the Code

Even when AI generates code, I make sure to understand what it's doing. This helps me:
- Debug issues when they arise
- Modify the code for my specific needs
- Learn new patterns and techniques

### 3. Iteration is Key

The best results come from an iterative process:
- Start with a basic implementation
- Test and identify issues
- Refine and improve with AI assistance
- Repeat until satisfied
- Deployment strategies and best practices

## My Recommendation

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, I encourage you to experiment with AI tools. Start small, stay curious, and remember that the goal is to become a better developer, not to let AI do all the thinking.

The future of development is collaborative â€“ between human creativity and AI capability. Let's embrace it together.
